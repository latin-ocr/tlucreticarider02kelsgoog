iv PREFACE.

text or notice in the commentnry the numerous msposifions
os lines suggested by Munro, because they axe a source os

The intmduction was prepared with the design of offering
some suggestions regaxding the personality of Lucretius, his
mission in philosophy, and his rank as a poet. In the notes
it has been the editor's aim not simply to explain the more
difficult word>fonns and eonstrucfions, but also to bring out
the philosophie impert os the passages annotated in the
light os both ancient and medem thought. Most classic-al
writings have an interest [or us mainly because of the general
human clement in them—because they crysmllize in artistic
form something that appeals to thinking men of all times and
os all nations. But Lucretius stands in cluse relation with
the life o( the present. His work is not lacking in the power
and finish that mark the true poen—one the dui-aion os
whose fame is to be measured not by decades, but by
centuries. At the same time his verse is the vehicle os a
philosophie system, which, reeurring srorn time to time in
the speculations os the past, has only in the present genera-
tion found its fullest development and exposition, and its
widest applicatiom The De Rerum Natura reveals ivs
deepest significance only when studied in connection with
the thought of to-day. ·
