111. LUCRETIUS As A POET.

(L) Lmanv Caeam-mmm or m Du Ratun Nam-uu.

Before attempting ιο {orm an :stimate oi Lucretius* poetic
power it ir necessary to inquire, first, whether the poem stands
toeday as it was lest ny iiim and, secondiy, whether it passed
imm the anthol-'s hands a: a finished work.

poem cone froin one original rnannscript, known u aire archs< y

passages, which have taxed the utmost ingenuity of commenta-
tors, without any certainty in the end of presenting what the
poet wrote Lucretii-s, morenver, wa, one whose views tire mon-

there have crept in many interpolations and transpositions οἱ
passages intended either ω reiute the argument or show the
puers inconsistency by qnoung irin· against hir-iscis. Time
enurs, as well as the unavnidabh blunders that abeund in
manuscripts, have been mosny corrected by the able critical
scholare who have εἰναι their attention tn the text, and now
“the great mass of the poem ¹’ is *⁴ in a round and satisfactory
state;'¹ but in nome places the thought oi the poet cannot be
determiued.
