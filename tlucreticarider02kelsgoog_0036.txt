LUCRETlus As Α PHILOSOPHER xxxi

In the »pates between the worlds the gods dwell. Their
bodies are of the most subtile matter. They have nothing to do
with the oxi-going of things m· the lite of mem they cnjoy

themselves with creating, nm· model to wod( froin. There i: no

Nevertheless. tlte chance that presides over the genesis nnd
dissolution of all things is not mere accident. There is a fixed
order in things. Lucretius well illustrans the legal tremi of the
Roman minti ; he gnspecl the unlty and hannony that nndcriic
