Any »yram ot philosophy is difficult to :reat ir. vers-23 it
involves necessarily the bringing in οἱ many prosalc elementa.
Whether n manerialistic theory ni tlte universe in this respect ir
worse off than others it is not easy ιο decide. A ‹heistie or
pantheistic system ha: at least one advantage.—that by appeal-
ing directly to a divine intelligence and power it may nave iteelt
much technical and tedious explanation in searching out «lie
